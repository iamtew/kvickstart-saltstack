# Kvickstart Saltstack

Simple wrapper around the Saltstack bootstrap script to install a master node and have its minion connect to itself for management. 

``kvickstart-saltstack-master.sh`` - Download and install the salt-master and salt-minion daemons on a system and perform basic configuration.


``kvickstart-saltstack-minion.sh`` - Download and install the salt-minion and connect to a specific master.

## Why?

Learning excercise to automate the whole Saltstack bootstrap process. Probably nothing you want to run in a production environment, but useful if you just want to play around a bit with salt.
